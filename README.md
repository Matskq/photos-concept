# photos-concept
HTML concept of Plex photos app

This is a web page, not a full application.
Made just as an concept, it doesn't function.

To use it download the code, and open it in a Chromium based browser.
Open developer tools, and select a mobile device such as the Pixel 2XL.
Browsers such as Firefox, will not work correctly.

It doesn't support other than mobile screens.
(but it can be viewed in any screen, some items will have odd scaling)
